# Teemu's TU Delft LaTeX Template

This repository contains my standard LaTeX template, which I mainly use for writing assignments and taking notes at the Delft University of Technology.
It contains several packages and shortcuts which I find particularly useful.

## Usage

1. Copy this directory to your desired directory.

    ```bash
    cp -r tu-delft-latex-template/ [your_dir]
    ```

2. Edit the file "document.tex" to your liking.

## Typesetting and LaTeX settings

* `a4paper` paper size with the `article` document class.
* `XCharter` for serif, `sourcesanspro` for sans serif, and `sourcecodepro` for monospace.
* Bibliography management with `biblatex`.
* Designed for use with `lualatex` and `biber`.
